# Welcome to PolyCalc!
polycalc.js is a library for doing math with polynomial functions!

## Documentation:
### Initialization:
> `const poly = new Polynomial(constants)`
  * `constants` = array of constants of polynomial.
  * So, for example `constants = [1, -2, 3]` would result in 'x^2 - 2x + 3'
