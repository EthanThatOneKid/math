# ShiffNumber Experimentation

## [ShiffNumber Test](https://ethanthatonekid.github.io/math/shiffnumber)

## Main Usage:
* `ShiffNumber(num, from, to, [digitsLength=7])`
  * `num` = any-based number
  * `from` = base of 'num'
  * `to` = target base of 'num'
  * `digitsLength` = amount of digits needed to accurately describe 'num' in the target base
